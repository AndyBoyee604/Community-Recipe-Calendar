# Recipe-Me

  ## Description
  We created this application so that users could have a one stop shop to find and share recipes. Users are able to create an account, post on the website, and interact with others. Recipe me also has a randomize function for those who donâ€™t want to spend time searching for a meal. One of the challenges we faced was getting our pages to render the correct user data, and the occasional merge conflict.
