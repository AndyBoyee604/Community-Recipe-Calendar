# Recipe-Me

  ## Description
    We created this application so that users could have a one stop shop to find and share recipes. This can be done via the dashboard where users who are logged in will be able to share external recipes. The get recipe page will also return a wide range of meals with key information such as ingredients and cooking directions. One of the challenges we faced was getting our data to correctly display, and a couple of merge conflicts.
